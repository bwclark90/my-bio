My name is Brandon Clark. 
I am a 30 years old.
I previously worked at the Microsoft Campus in Redmond, WA as a Security Analyst which sparked my interest in coding.
When I wasn't working, I was taking all of the free classes that Microsoft offered.
I recently moved back home to Cypress, CA in order to change my career to a computer programmer.
